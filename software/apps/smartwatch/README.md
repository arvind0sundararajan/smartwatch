BLE TX Example
==============

Sends BLE advertisements from Buckler. Advertisements are broadcast
transmissions used to discover the device which can also include up to 23 bytes
of arbitrary payload data.

Advertisements can be received by any BLE scanner. The simplest way to test it
out is to use your smartphone. We recommend the "nRF Connect" app on Android
and iOS. Alternatively, the BLE RX example application can be loaded on a
separate Buckler in order to receive advertisements.
